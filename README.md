# Oasis Infobyte Internship
Welcome to my Oasis Infobyte internship repository! This repository contains four Web Development Projects that I worked on during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. Each project showcases different aspects of Web Developing.

# Calculator
I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a dynamic Calculator for this challenge. This console-based programme performs elementary mathematical calculations, making it an excellent learning tool for conditionals, switch statements, and processing user input. a first step towards learning fundamental programming principles.

# Tribute Page
The focus of Task 2 was using HTML and CSS to foster creativity. I created an engaging Tribute Page in honour of the illustrious Leonardo da Vinci. In addition to showcasing my abilities in online content architecture, this project focused on the blending of aesthetics and content to produce an engaging user experience.

# To-Do WebApp
The quest proceeded with a step into interactive Web Development. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed and created a to-do app. With this application, I was able to show my skills in designing user-friendly interfaces and engaging user interactions, from adding tasks to marking them as done.

# Login Authentication System
I explored user management and web security for Task 4. I built a strong Login Authentication System using Firebase. This system makes it simple for users to sign up, log in, and visit a secure website. An essential investigation on securing web applications from unauthorised access.
